## License

### Since version 22.1 non-commercial license is available upon request only <sup>{2}</sup>

[Syntevo's blog from 19 October 2022](https://www.syntevo.com/blog/?p=5363) explains that licensing options have been changed with version 22.1. Non-commercial license is only available for:

1. open-source developers,
2. students and employees of (select) educational institutions, and
3. charitable non-governmental organizations,
4. hobby users (requires 23.1 preview).

Any of these have [conditions that need to be fulfilled](https://www.syntevo.com/register-non-commercial/), before a non-commercial license can be issued, or have some restrictions. For example, a hobby license restricts your use to repositories "where you are the only author/committer or which are open source".
