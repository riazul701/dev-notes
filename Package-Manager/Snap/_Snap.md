## App Auto Update

* {4} [Flatpak vs. Snap: 10 Differences You Should Know](https://itsfoss.com/flatpak-vs-snap/)
  * Snap applications get updated automatically by default. The user can modify when and how often the updates happen. Also, you can hold and postpone updates for selected snaps.
  * On the contrary, Flatpak packages do not get updated automatically. If you have Flatpak integration with the software center, you will be notified of available updates, but it will not be forcefully updated.

## Test Code

* Check "smplayer" package installed or not: `snap list | awk '{print $1}' | grep smplayer`
* To execute software installation script enter into sudo mode `sudo su` for one time.
* Execute script: `./snap-install.sh`
