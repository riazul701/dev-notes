## Notes

* PATHs
  * Snap binaries (graphical and command-line) are located at: `/snap/bin`
  * Snap ".desktop"/Menu files are located at: `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications`
  * Snap cache files are located at: `/var/lib/snapd/cache` <sup>{3}</sup>

* In Q4OS ("Q4OS 5.6 TDE (64bit).vdi"), Snap adds software to $PATH, for both graphical and command-line software. Also Snap adds software to Menu.
* In SparkyLinux ("sparkylinux-7.6-x86_64-minimalgui.iso"), Snap does not add software to $PATH, for both graphical and command-line software. Also Snap does not add software to Menu.

## App Auto Update

* {4} [Flatpak vs. Snap: 10 Differences You Should Know](https://itsfoss.com/flatpak-vs-snap/)
  * Snap applications get updated automatically by default. The user can modify when and how often the updates happen. Also, you can hold and postpone updates for selected snaps.
  * On the contrary, Flatpak packages do not get updated automatically. If you have Flatpak integration with the software center, you will be notified of available updates, but it will not be forcefully updated.

## Test Code
* Install package: `sudo snap install smplayer`
* Check "smplayer" package installed or not: `snap list | awk '{print $1}' | grep smplayer`
* To execute software installation script enter into sudo mode `sudo su` for one time.
* Execute script: `./snap-install.sh`
  * Error: `bash: ./snap-install.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`
  * Get bash path: `which bash` [Shows output: `/usr/bin/bash`]
  * Change "End Of Line": In Notepad++ Edit->EOL Conversion->Unix (LF)
