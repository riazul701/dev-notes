## Notes
* During Image Backup and Restore, if single partition restored with partition table, then GRUB/Bootloader does not work, because GRUB partition replaced.
* During Clone, if single partition restored with partition table, then GRUB/Bootloader works perfectly.
* Rescuezilla supports VirtualBox ".VDI" image. For testing, copy ".VDI" image to virtual machine using "Mount" or "SSH".
* Using Rescuezilla, we can setup Real-PC from VirtualBox ".VDI" image.
