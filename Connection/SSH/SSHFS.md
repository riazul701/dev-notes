## Linux\\SSHFS

### Linux Setup (SSHFS)

* {40} [How do I specify SSH options for SSHFS?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/975818/how-do-i-specify-ssh-options-for-sshfs)

* Setup Instructions
  * Install SSHFS: `sudo apt install sshfs`
  * Check SSHFS is installed: `which sshfs`
  * Create folder for mount: 
    * `cd /mnt`
    * `sudo mkdir <folder-name>`
  * Mount Device via SSHFS: `sudo sshfs -o allow_other,IdentityFile=/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa -p <port:22> <user>@101.102.103.104:/ /mnt/<folder-name>/`
  * Unmount: `sudo umount /mnt/<folder-name>`

* Add Android Mobile

  * Using Termux CLI
    * If empty mount, but shows storage size, then delete-and-create existing mount folder.
    * Open Termux on Android and start SSH server: `sshd`
    * Open Terminal in Linux-OS
    * Create folder for mount: 
    * `cd /mnt`
    * `sudo mkdir <folder-name>`
    * Mount Device via SSHFS: `sudo sshfs -o allow_other,IdentityFile=/home/<local-user>/.ssh/id_rsa -p <port:8022> <remote-user>@<remote-ip>:/storage/emulated/0/ /mnt/<folder-name>/`  [Get Termux username: `whoami`] [Get path by "SSH/SFTP Server BY Banana Studio App" -> Users -> Alias]
    * Unmount: `sudo umount /mnt/<folder-name>`

  * [SSH/SFTP Server - Terminal BY Banana Studio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.xnano.android.sshserver)
    * Install this Android software from Play Store
    * Set Alias/Location (from "Users" tab) for both Phone-Memory and SD-Card (As different SSH user)
    * Open Terminal in Linux-OS
    * Create two folder "/home/<local-user>/mount/<phone-memory-folder>" and "/home/<local-user>/mount/<sdcard-folder>"
    * Mount Phone Memory: `sshfs -p <port:2222> <remote-user>@<remote-ip>:/ /home/<local-user>/mount/<phone-memory-folder>/` ["sudo" does not work here and "/mnt" path. Shows error "read: Connection reset by peer"]
    * Mount SD-Card: `sshfs -p <port:2222> <remote-user>@<remote-ip>:/ /home/<local-user>/mount/<sdcard-folder>/`
