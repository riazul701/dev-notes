## Notes

* Create emergency light with router UPS: Router UPS is connected to a IPS backup enabled socket. Light is attached to router UPS. When IPS backup is finished, then attached light in router UPS will be turned on automatically.

* Should not use UPS directly to provide electricity to 12Volt DC solar fan for backup, because inside UPS battery DC to AC conversion losses 25% capacity and solar fan adapter's AC to DC conversion losses another 30%. In total approximately 55% battery capacity losses. <sup>ChatGPT: "inverter loss from 12 volt dc to 220 volt ac from 7.5 ah battery" && "220 volt AC to 12 volt DC adapter loss"</sup>
  * Instead use router UPS, because it does not convert DC to AC current and again not AC to DC current.

* Check UPS battery charger has auto charging cut feature and full charge indicator.
