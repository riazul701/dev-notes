  * Desktop wifi adapter has 150Mbps data transfer speed.
  * Laptop built-in wifi adapter has 90Mbps data transfer speed.
  * Mobile built-in wifi has 50Mbps data transfer speed.
  * During data transmission, Lowest speed will be applied.
  * If did not get lowest data transmission speed, then check wires, usb hub.
  * For some low quality wire, usb hub can not get expected data transmission speed.
  * For better speed use Ethernet cable, also can use USB to Ethernet converter.
