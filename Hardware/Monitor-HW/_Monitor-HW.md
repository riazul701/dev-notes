* Opinions and Comments
* {21} [Don't Make THIS Mistake!! BY Hardware Mana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVeE-zAQkFI)
  * @amitmisra9438 => Very clear advice in your channel that i really want that for normal coding and work 21.5 is a best monitor. Thanks for sharing your critical advice as everyone says go for big which will damage your experience in case of 2 feet table. Keep it Up
  * @farazalikhan5242 => I am using a 24" 1080p monitor and I can see some pixels when I look closely, So I would recommend going for 1440p or 4k for 27"or above monitors. As the picture will be much crisper
  * @QuantumCanvas07 => I'll get a macbook air m3 and external monitor this year.  macOS doesn't allow subpixel anti-aliasing and for people on a budget, the perfect PPI according to reddit would be half of apple retina display (~220 PPI) that is ~110 PPI.
  * @aniket8350 => But it also depends on the viewing distance right.
  * @iamdshanbhag => I agree i recently bought 27 inch monitor and returned it became of the pixelated issue. [Full HD Monitor]
  * @arrowRX => Good content bro, i dont understand why even companies selling 1080 27, sharpness is bad. Nice editing, nice content overall, keep adding more videos.
    * @HardwareMana => Some people just buy it for the size. It's more of a TV at that point and not a monitor.
  * @kunalsehgal3481 => Lol even before watching this video I bought a 22 inch full hd monitor instead of 24 inch just because of ppi. For me size doesn't matter that much, but I don't want a grainy display on a new monitor.
  * @swarajroy5631 => 27inch hamesha 2k k upar kharidna chaiye.
