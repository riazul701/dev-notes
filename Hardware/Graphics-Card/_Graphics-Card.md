# Graphics Drivers

## Linux OS

  * Notes
    * NVIDIA graphics driver has serious compatibility problem with Linux. It does not work out of the box on Linux and manual installation is very difficult.
    * AMD graphics card has open-source linux graphics drivers (built-in on linux kernel) and supports linux os natively. No need to install graphics drivers manually.
  * Comments
    * @garrettrinquest1605: Linux isn't more complicated unless you use Nvidia. I've actually spent time getting AMD graphics drivers working on my work computer running Windows. It's still not that hard, but it does take some small amount of time and effort. On Linux, my AMD card just works.
    * @luanlmd: I've been using Linux for 15+ years and switched my gaming computer to Linux since Valve launched Steam for Linux in 2012. I never completely understood the mess of these drivers and I don't want to be messing around with NVIDIA crap all the time, for that reason, I just buy AMD cards that run well with the free drivers and forget this mess even exists.
