## Notes

* Windows 11: You need a processor that must be in the 8th generation. <sup>{2}</sup>
  * [Windows Processor Requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements)
  * Windows 11 requires TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0 in Processor/Motherboard. Check it, before buying.
  
* Integrated Graphics <sup>{20}</sup>
  * AMD processor name ends with letter "G" means, it has integrated graphics and this processor is called APU (Accelarated Processing Unit). All other AMD processors except this naming do not have graphics inbuilt and require external graphics card to get monitor output.
  * Intel processor name ends with letter "F" means, it does not have integrated graphics and require external graphics card to get monitor output. All other Intel processors (has letter "G" in name) except this have integrated graphics.

## Processor List

* Most Popular AMD Processors
  * AMD Ryzen 5 5600g (Best Budget Friendly)
  * AMD Ryzen 5 3400g (Old)
  * AMD Ryzen 5 2200g (Old)

* AMD has been pretty quiet about the entry-level 8600G and 8700G CPUs, but why? With reduced PCIe lanes, Zen4c cores, a pretty beefy built-in GPU. <sup>{21}</sup>
