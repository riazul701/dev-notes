* User router ups like "wgp", "pcpower", "olax", "ske" etc.

**Automatically Switch Wifi/Sim Network On Devices**

* Keep network/wifi/sim based internet usage logs on each device.

* On Android Mobile
  * Generally always connected to wifi and turned off sim internet.
  * If goes out of wifi coverage or no internet in wifi, then automatically turn on sim internet. Using Tasker/MacroDroid, NetGuard application restrict heavy usage internet application like youtube, facebook, linkedin, tiktok etc.
  * If goes into wifi coverage or wifi internet is restored, then automatically turn off sim internet. Using Tasker/MacroDroid, NetGuard application allow all applications to use unrestricted internet.
  * Manually temporarily disable previous sim internet rules, so that sim internet can not be turned on automatically. Do this during heavy internet usage applications like youtube, facebook, linkedin, tiktok etc.

* On Computer
  * Attach two internet device - broadband wifi + modem.
  * By default use internet from broadband wifi.
  * If internet is not available in broadband wifi, then use internet from modem.
  * Inefficient Method: If using internet from modem, then how to know/get-back to broadband wifi when internet is restored on it.

**Risky/Damange HDD (Don't Do This): Attach/Detach Regular/Desktop Hard Disk Into Desktop Computer**

* Risky/Damange HDD (Don't Do This): Get/create an extra multiplug and control multiplug's power through `ESP32` and `Relay`. Buy one plug, one mk-box, one socket, some wire and build it yourself.
  * Risky/Damange HDD (Don't Do This): For regular/desktop hard disk turning on/off, first check with a cheap 160 GB old/refurbished hard disk.

* (Don't Do This) Use hard disk box: [Ugreen 50422 3.5 Inch USB 3.0 Hard disk Box (50422)](https://www.ryans.com/ugreen-35-inch-usb-30-hard-disk-box-50422)
* (Don't Do This) [Ugreen CM198 (50857) 2.5/3.5 inch USB 3.0 2 Bay Black External HDD/SSD Dock #50857](https://www.ryans.com/ugreen-cm198-2.5-3.5-inch-usb-3.0-2-bay-black-external-hdd-ssd-dock)

**Attach/Detach Portable Hard Disk Into Desktop Computer --OR-- SIM Wifi Router**

* Relay (Electrical) Way => use `ESP32` and `Relay` to turn on/off portable hard disk --OR-- sim wifi router. Get an extra usb extension cable, cut red wire (power supply wire) and attach two pieces to `Relay`. For safety purpose, cut all wire (red, black etc.) and use separate `Relay` for each wire. Buy multil `Relay` combo pack.
  * For portable hard disk turning on/off, first check with usb light and then cheap pendrive for safety purpose.
  * Safer way for sim wifi router: Get/create an extra multiplug and control multiplug's power through `ESP32` and `Relay`. Cheap multiplug with one socket/port is enough, because sim wifi router has only 5-10 watt load. Buy one plug, one mk-box, one socket, some wire and build it yourself.

* Button Press (Physical) Way => Buy usb-hub with power buttons and external power adapter.
  * External power adapter supplies additional power for portable hard disk. 
  * Buy round press only button model, one press turns on usb, another press turns off usb. Do not buy traditional electrical switch like button.
  * For arduino/esp32/servo-motor, press only button is required.

* Buy ESP32 with wifi and bluetooth enabled
  * Using wifi and servo motor, remotely press usb-hub's power button to turn on usb. Again press to turn off usb.
  * Use medium/api/chat to transfer wifi signal from android phone to ESP32: MQTT with Cloud Broker (e.g., Adafruit IO, HiveMQ, Mosquitto), Blynk IoT Platform, Telegram Bot API, Firebase Realtime Database, Ngrok Tunnel (for development).

**Laptop's Power Button Presser(Pusher)**
  
* When wifi smart plug/socket is turned on, then after 5 seconds press latptop's power button using arduino and servo motor.
* Laptop has battery, for this reason it can not be turned off like desktop when hangs. Use wifi enabled ESP32 to remotely press power button for 5 seconds to forcefully turn off laptop when hangs.

**If Broadband Wifi Does Not Have Internet, Then Turn ON SIM Wifi**

* Keep network/wifi/sim based internet usage logs on each device.

* In every 5 minutes, check broadband wifi has internet access or not. If broadband wifi does not have internet, then turn on sim wifi router by pressing multiplug's power button.
* On computer, if connected to sim wifi, then block heavy internet usage websites in chrome like youtube, tiktok. Also block internet for download manager. Do this using chrome extension and firewall rule. Show notification/color-changes/text using i3, polybar, komorebi, glazewm, yasb.
* On mobile, if connected to sim wifi, then block heavy internet usage apps like youtube, tiktok. Do this using android app.
* Restrict SIM Wifi Usage
  * On Computer: Create a bash script that detects wifi ssid/name. Based on ssid create firewall rules to block website, application. Run this script every minute using cron/windows-task-scheduler.
  * On Android: Install `Tasker` and `NetGuard` paid/premium application. Detect wifi ssid/name changes using `Tasker` and restrict application using `NetGuard`. `NetGuard` has `Tasker` integration plugin. No "root" required.

**Timely On/Off Broadband Wifi Router**

* Arduino RTC (Real Time Clock) module is required.
* In every 10 minutes, check broadband wifi has signal, internet access is not required.
* If broadband usage allowed time and no wifi signal, then press electric switch on side. If wifi signal already present, then do nothing.
* If broadband usage blocked time and has wifi signal, then press electric switch off side. If wifi signal already absent, then do nothing. Do this checking and work at specific time/moment, do not do this repeatedly, because anyone can use broadband in blocked time.

**No Electricity Notification**

* Using Arduino (ESP32/ESP8266) make a system to notify computer using wifi (optional alarm sound), when no electricity and show notification/color-changes/text using i3, polybar, komorebi, glazewm, yasb. So that, computer can be turned off quickly after saving works because UPS backup time is very limited.
* When using computer remotely, then show no electricity notification/color-changes/text to both desktop-environment/window-manager using i3, polybar, komorebi, glazewm, yasb (connected via rustdesk) and terminal tmux (connected via ssh).
* Also send no electricity notification to android mobile using internet.
* Broadband/SIM wifi router is powered by router-ups.

**DIY Wifi Smart Plug/Socket**

* Buy "SONOFF" or "LDNIO" wifi smart plug/socket. It's better than DIY.
* Get/create an extra multiplug and control multiplug's power through `ESP32` and `Relay` using internet. Buy two plug, two mk-box, two socket, some wire and build it yourself - one is for computer's CPU/system-unit and another is for monitor.

**Timely Provide Water In Garden**

* Needs float switch in main water tank. If there is no water in main water tank, then turning on 12V DC motor is meaningless.
  * 220V AC float switch has fatal electric shock risk, if electrical wire is leaked into water.
  * Using arduino and ultrasonic sensor, water level can be detected. Using water level data, main water pump/motor can be turned on/off using wifi smart plug/socket.

* Directly connect DC motor to arduino without resistor, can damage it.
* Arduino RTC (Real Time Clock) module is required.
* At specific time, turn on the 12V DC water motor and after several minutes turn it off.
* Water motor speed can be controlled using speed-switch.
* Drop water to ground/soil with making noise (like main AC water motor and tank), so that anyone can observe that dc motor is running.
* This project can be remote controlled.

**Make Water Level Indicator And Switch For Water Tank**

* Using arduino and ultrasonic sensor, water level can be detected.
* Show output in LCD display like volume up/down style.
* Use ESP32 to remotely show output in LCD display.
* Test this project in 1 bucket of water.
* Can use wifi smart plug/socket to turn on/off 1HP water pump/motor. There should be bypass/additional manual switch/socket instead of wifi smart plug/socket.
* Controlling a smart Wi-Fi plug using an ESP32 is possible, but the approach depends on the plug model and whether it allows local control (LAN access) or only through the cloud. [ChatGPT Question: "control smart wifi plug using esp32"]

# Project Details

## DIY Smart Button Presser(Pusher) <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

* When wifi smart plug/socket is turned on, then wait 5 seconds before pressing laptop's power button. Because laptop's charger should provide electricity before pressing power button.

* Arduino Information
  * Arduino has several versions: Uno, Nano, Mega 2560, Leonardo, Micro. "Arduino Uno" version is used for most of the works. <sup>{8}</sup>
  * [Arduino Uno R3 SMD Development Board with USB Cable for Projects](https://bigyanproject.com/en/arduino/arduino-uno-smd)

* Servo Motor Information
  * Power servo motor from Arduino
  * Power a small servo motor with a mobile charger
  * [SG90 Micro Servo Motor 180 Degree => Most used servo motor. Contains arduino and servo motor short video overview](https://bigyanproject.com/en/servo/sg90-micro-servo-motor)
  * [MG995 360 Degree Metal Gear Servo Motor – High Torque => Not needed for button presser/pusher](https://bigyanproject.com/en/servo/mg995-servo-motor-360-metal)

**ChatGPT Question: "diy servo motor button presser"**

* Great! A DIY servo motor button presser is a relatively simple and useful project. You can create a device that physically presses a button using a servo motor and a microcontroller like an `ESP32`, `ESP8266`, or `Arduino`.

* What You’ll Need
  * Item => Description
  * Servo Motor (e.g. SG90) => Small, affordable, perfect for simple motion like pushing
  * Microcontroller (ESP32 / ESP8266 / Arduino Nano/Uno) => Controls the servo
  * Power Source (e.g. USB or battery pack) => Powers the setup
  * Optional: Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capability => For remote control via app or voice
  * Mounting hardware or 3D printed frame => To hold the servo in place
  * Arm or stick attached to servo horn => Acts as the “finger” to push the button

* Basic Wiring
  * For ESP32 + SG90 Servo:
```mathematica
SG90 Servo Motor:
 - Brown wire → GND
 - Red wire → 5V
 - Orange/Yellow wire → GPIO pin (e.g. D13)
```
  * Power the servo with 5V, not 3.3V — ESP32 itself can’t supply enough current, so consider external 5V if needed.

* Example Arduino Code (ESP32 / Arduino)
```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myServo;

void setup() {
  myServo.attach(13);  // Connect servo signal to GPIO 13
  myServo.write(0);    // Start in rest position
}

void loop() {
  delay(2000);         // Wait 2 seconds
  myServo.write(90);   // Push the button
  delay(1000);         // Hold it
  myServo.write(0);    // Release
  delay(10000);        // Wait 10 seconds before pressing again
}
```
  * Adjust angles (e.g. 90 and 0) to suit the range needed to push and release your specific button.

* Mounting Options
  * Use double-sided tape, hot glue, or a 3D printed bracket to secure the servo next to the button.
  * Attach a lever or finger to the servo horn — something stiff enough to press the button firmly.

* Optional: Add Remote Control
  * If you use an `ESP8266` or `ESP32`, you can:
    * Add a web server to press the button via browser
    * Integrate with Home Assistant, Alexa, or Google Home (using ESPHome or Tasmota firmware)
    * Use `Blynk`, `MQTT`, or `IFTTT` to trigger from your phone

* Upgrade Ideas
  * Feature => How
  * Schedule presses => Add RTC or time-based logic
  * Remote control => Use Wi-Fi + web server or ESPHome
  * Voice command => Link to Alexa/Google Assistant
  * Battery power => Use 18650 cells or USB power bank

* Visual Concept
  * Imagine this:
```css
[Button Panel]
   ↑
[FINGER ARM] ← Attached to
[Servo Motor] ← Mounted on a stand or surface
   ↑
[ESP32 board] ← Powers and controls the servo
```

* Would you like a diagram, 3D print model, or wiring schematic? I can generate or help you build one based on your exact button style or space constraints.

## Switch Wifi If No Internet <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGPT Question: "ESP32 checks if one wifi does not have internet then start another"**

* Yes, this is possible! You can program the ESP32 to:
  * 1. Connect to Wi-Fi Network A
  * 2. Check if there is internet access
  * 3. If no internet → Switch to Wi-Fi Network B
  * This is useful for failover Wi-Fi scenarios — like fallback from home Wi-Fi to a mobile hotspot.

* What You'll Need
  * An ESP32 board
  * Two known Wi-Fi SSIDs and passwords (let’s call them `WiFi1` and `WiFi2`)
  * Use `WiFi.h` and HTTP client to test internet access

* How It Works
  * Try to connect to `WiFi1`
  * Once connected, ping an external server (e.g. `http://google.com`)
  * If no response (timeout/error), disconnect and try `WiFi2`

* Example Code
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>

const char* ssid1 = "YourWiFi1";
const char* password1 = "YourPassword1";

const char* ssid2 = "YourWiFi2";
const char* password2 = "YourPassword2";

bool checkInternetConnection() {
  HTTPClient http;
  http.begin("http://example.com"); // Use a reliable server
  int httpCode = http.GET();
  http.end();
  return (httpCode > 0);
}

bool connectToWiFi(const char* ssid, const char* password) {
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  Serial.print("Connecting to ");
  Serial.println(ssid);

  unsigned long startAttemptTime = millis();
  const int timeout = 10000; // 10 seconds

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED && millis() - startAttemptTime < timeout) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }

  if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.println("\nConnected!");
    return true;
  } else {
    Serial.println("\nFailed to connect.");
    return false;
  }
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Try WiFi 1
  if (connectToWiFi(ssid1, password1)) {
    if (checkInternetConnection()) {
      Serial.println("WiFi1 has internet.");
      return;
    } else {
      Serial.println("WiFi1 has no internet.");
      WiFi.disconnect(true);
    }
  }

  // Try WiFi 2
  if (connectToWiFi(ssid2, password2)) {
    if (checkInternetConnection()) {
      Serial.println("WiFi2 has internet.");
      return;
    } else {
      Serial.println("WiFi2 has no internet.");
    }
  }

  Serial.println("No working Wi-Fi found.");
}

void loop() {
  // Your main code here
}
```

* Notes
  * `http.begin("http://example.com")` → use a stable server; `http://captive.apple.com` is another good one.
  * If you want to repeat this check regularly (e.g. every few minutes), put this logic in a function and call it when `WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED`.

* Optional Features
  * Feature => How
  * Retry periodically => Use `millis()` timer or `Ticker` library
  * Reconnect on disconnect => Monitor `WiFi.status()` in `loop()`
  * Use ESP32's multiple Wi-Fi support => ESP32 only connects to one network at a time; you must disconnect manually
  * Save preferred network => Use `Preferences` library or `EEPROM`

* Would you like me to modify this code to automatically switch back to WiFi1 if it becomes available again later?

## Remotely Control Arduino (ESP32/ESP8266) Using Internet <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGPT Question: "arduino remote wifi control without public ip"**

* If you want to control an Arduino over Wi-Fi without using a public IP, there are several reliable approaches that work well for local or remote access while avoiding the need to expose your device to the open internet.

* Key Methods to Control Arduino Remotely (No Public IP Required)

* 1. Using MQTT with Cloud Broker (e.g., Adafruit IO, HiveMQ, Mosquitto)
  * Arduino (ESP8266/ESP32) connects to Wi-Fi and communicates with a cloud MQTT broker.
  * Control commands are published to a topic from a smartphone or PC app.
  * No port forwarding or public IP needed.
  * Pros:
    * Secure, lightweight protocol
    * Real-time communication
    * Free brokers available
  * Libraries:
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>
```

* 2. Blynk IoT Platform
  * Blynk offers a mobile app and cloud service.
  * You upload a sketch to your Arduino with a Blynk library and auth token.
  * Control widgets on your phone (buttons, sliders, etc.) control the device remotely.
  * Pros:
    * Easiest GUI-based remote control
    * Secure cloud connection
    * Works behind NAT (no public IP needed)
  * Libraries:
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp32.h>
```
    * Note: Use the new Blynk 2.0 platform (https://blynk.io/).

* 3. Telegram Bot API
  * Your Arduino uses the Telegram API to check for messages sent to your bot.
  * Commands are parsed and executed accordingly.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to set up
    * Works without public IP
    * Free and secure
  * Libraries:
```cpp
#include <UniversalTelegramBot.h>
```

* 4. Firebase Realtime Database

  * Your mobile app or web dashboard updates Firebase remotely.
  * Pros:
    * Google-hosted, reliable
    * Good for structured control/data logging
  * Libraries:
    * `Firebase_ESP_Client` (by Mobizt)

* 5. Ngrok Tunnel (for development)
  * Use Ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local Arduino server (e.g., ESP32 running web server).
  * This temporarily exposes your local device to the internet through a secure URL.
  * Pros:
    * Easy remote access during development
    * No router config needed
  * Cons:
    * Not ideal for permanent deployment

* Which Board Works Best?
  * Use an `ESP32` or `ESP8266`:
    * Built-in Wi-Fi
    * Compatible with all methods above
    * Arduino IDE support

* Example: Blynk + ESP32 Setup
```cpp
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "YourTemplateID"
#define BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME "YourDevice"
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "YourAuthToken"

#include <WiFi.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp32.h>

char ssid[] = "YourSSID";
char pass[] = "YourPassword";

void setup() {
  Blynk.begin(BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN, ssid, pass);
}

void loop() {
  Blynk.run();
}
```

* Would you like help setting up one of these methods (e.g., Blynk, MQTT, or Telegram)? I can guide you step-by-step.

## No Electricity Notification <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGPT Question: "arduino notify computer with wifi about no electricity"**

* You can make an Arduino (ESP8266 or ESP32) notify your computer over Wi-Fi when electricity goes off (i.e., power outage detection). This can be done using a web server, HTTP request, or MQTT.

* How It Works (Concept)
  * 1. A power supply (like a 5V adapter) plugged into the AC line indicates that mains power is available.
  * 2. When mains power is lost, the adapter turns off → Arduino detects it (via a digital pin).
  * 3. Arduino (ESP8266/ESP32) sends a Wi-Fi notification to your computer via:
    * Local HTTP server (on your PC)
    * MQTT broker (like Mosquitto)
    * Web dashboard or email (via IFTTT, etc.)

* Hardware Needed
  * Component => Purpose
  * ESP8266 (NodeMCU) or ESP32 => Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino
  * USB phone charger (5V) => Detect AC power presence
  * Diode (e.g. 1N4007) + Voltage divider => Safe voltage input
  * Resistors => For voltage sensing or pull-down
  * Computer on same Wi-Fi => To receive notification

* Wiring (Safe Method)
  * Use a 5V adapter plugged into AC. Connect its 5V output to a digital input pin via a resistor voltage divider (optional protection).
  * ESP Pin => Connected To [Table Heading]
    * D1 (GPIO5) => From 5V adapter output (via divider)
    * GND => GND of adapter and board
  * ESP is powered separately via USB or a battery pack.

* Code Example (ESP8266 HTTP Notification)
  * This code sends a simple HTTP request to your computer when power is lost.
  * Arduino Sketch (ESP8266)
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>

const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

const char* serverIP = "192.168.1.100";  // Your computer's IP address
const int powerSensePin = D1;  // Connected to 5V adapter output

bool powerPreviouslyOn = true;

void setup() {
  pinMode(powerSensePin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(115200);

  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("WiFi connected");
}

void loop() {
  int powerStatus = digitalRead(powerSensePin);

  if (powerStatus == LOW && powerPreviouslyOn) {
    // Power has just gone OFF
    sendPowerOffNotification();
    powerPreviouslyOn = false;
  } else if (powerStatus == HIGH && !powerPreviouslyOn) {
    // Power restored
    sendPowerOnNotification();
    powerPreviouslyOn = true;
  }

  delay(500);  // Adjust as needed
}

void sendPowerOffNotification() {
  if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    HTTPClient http;
    String url = "http://" + String(serverIP) + ":5000/poweroff";
    http.begin(url);
    int httpCode = http.GET();
    http.end();
    Serial.println("Power OFF notification sent.");
  }
}

void sendPowerOnNotification() {
  if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    HTTPClient http;
    String url = "http://" + String(serverIP) + ":5000/poweron";
    http.begin(url);
    int httpCode = http.GET();
    http.end();
    Serial.println("Power ON notification sent.");
  }
}
```

* How to Receive Notification on Your PC
  
  * Option 1: Python HTTP Server on Your Computer
    * Run this Python script on your PC:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/poweroff')
def power_off():
    print("⚠️ Power OFF detected!")
    return "OK"

@app.route('/poweron')
def power_on():
    print("✅ Power RESTORED!")
    return "OK"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
  * Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask
```
  * Run:
```python
python power_notify.py
```

* What Happens
  * When AC power cuts off, the 5V adapter stops supplying power → ESP detects LOW → sends `http://your-ip:5000/poweroff`
  * Your PC’s Python script prints the warning.
  * When power is restored, another message is sent.

* Notes
  * Make sure your computer IP is static (or use mDNS).
  * Both PC and ESP must be on the same network.
  * Use a voltage divider or opto-isolator to protect the ESP pin from over-voltage.
  * Add email or desktop popup alerts using your Python script (can integrate with Notify, Slack, or Telegram).

* Would you like help extending this to send email, desktop notifications, or Telegram alerts too?

## Wifi Controlled USB Switch For Portable HDD <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGTP Question: "arduino wifi controlled usb switch for portable hard disk"**

* To build an Arduino Wi-Fi controlled USB switch to remotely control the power to a portable hard disk, you'll essentially need to cut or enable power to the USB line. Here's how to approach this:

* Goal:
  * Turn USB power on/off via Wi-Fi, so that a portable hard drive can be remotely powered on/off using an Arduino.

* Parts Needed:
  * 1. Arduino with Wi-Fi
    * ESP8266 (e.g., NodeMCU or Wemos D1 mini) or
    * ESP32
  * 2. USB Power Control Switch (Options below)
  * 3. Relay module or MOSFET (for switching power)
  * 4. Micro USB breakout board or USB extension cable (cuttable)
  * 5. External 5V power supply (optional but recommended for stable power)
  * 6. Jumper wires, soldering tools, case/enclosure

* Design Overview:
  * The ESP8266/ESP32 acts as a Wi-Fi web server. You connect to it via your phone or PC and toggle the USB power. The microcontroller switches a relay or MOSFET that cuts or enables 5V power to the USB port that powers your hard disk.

* USB Power Switching Methods:
  * Option 1: Use a Relay
    * Use a 5V relay module to cut the 5V line going to the USB device.
    * Safe for low-speed control and electrically isolated.
  * Option 2: Use a P-Channel MOSFET
    * More compact, silent, and power-efficient than a relay.
    * Use a P-Channel MOSFET like IRF9540 with pull-down resistor and gate control.

* Wiring Diagram (Relay Example):
```rust
USB Cable (from power source) --> Relay --> USB Cable (to HDD)

NodeMCU:
  D1 (GPIO5) --> Relay IN
  GND       --> Relay GND
  5V        --> Relay VCC
```

* ESP8266 Code Example (Basic Web Server):
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

int relayPin = D1;

WiFiServer server(80);

void setup() {
  pinMode(relayPin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW); // Start with power OFF

  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) delay(1000);

  server.begin();
  Serial.print("Connected IP: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}

void loop() {
  WiFiClient client = server.available();
  if (!client) return;

  while (!client.available()) delay(1);

  String request = client.readStringUntil('\r');
  client.flush();

  if (request.indexOf("/on") != -1) digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH);
  if (request.indexOf("/off") != -1) digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW);

  client.println("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
  client.println("Content-Type: text/html");
  client.println();
  client.println("<html><body>");
  client.println("<h1>USB Power Control</h1>");
  client.println("<a href=\"/on\">Turn ON</a><br>");
  client.println("<a href=\"/off\">Turn OFF</a><br>");
  client.println("</body></html>");
}
```

* Important Notes:
  * Only switch the 5V line, never the data lines (D+/D−) unless you know what you're doing.
  * Some hard drives draw more current than the relay/MOSFET can safely handle – always check specs.
  * USB power from your Arduino is not enough for an HDD; use external power routed through the relay/MOSFET.

* Optional: Add Status LED or OTA Updates
  * Let me know if you'd like a version using:
    * Blynk / MQTT / Home Assistant integration
    * PCB design
    * 3D-printable enclosure
    * ESP32 instead of ESP8266

* Would you like help choosing the exact parts or a schematic?

**ChatGPT Question: "power required for portable hard disk"**

* The power required for a portable hard disk depends on its type and size, but here's a practical breakdown:

* Typical Power Requirements:
  * Type of Drive => Power Required
  * 2.5" Portable HDD (USB) => 0.5–1.0A @ 5V (2.5–5W)
  * 3.5" Desktop HDD => 12V @ 0.5–2A + 5V @ 0.5–1A
  * SSD (2.5" USB) => 0.2–0.5A @ 5V (1–2.5W)

* USB Power Limits:
  * USB Type => Max Current => Power
  * USB 2.0 => 500 mA => 2.5 W
  * USB 3.0/3.1 => 900 mA – 1.5A => 4.5–7.5 W
  * Most 2.5" portable USB drives are designed to run off USB 3.0 ports, which can provide up to 5V @ 900mA–1500mA.

* Example Devices:
  * Device Example => Peak Power (Startup) => Sustained
  * WD My Passport 1TB (USB 3.0) => ~1.0A @ 5V (5W) => ~0.6A @ 5V (3W)
  * Seagate Backup Plus 2TB => ~0.8–1.0A @ 5V => ~0.5A
  * Samsung T5 SSD => ~0.4A @ 5V => ~0.2A

* Startup Surge:
  * Portable HDDs often draw more power at startup (up to 1.0–1.2A for a second or two) due to motor spin-up.
  * Some Arduinos or cheap USB relays can't handle this surge — use external 5V power if switching USB power.

* Recommended Power Supply (for switching via Arduino):
  * 5V @ 2A USB adapter — safe for most 2.5" drives
  * Relay/MOSFET should handle at least 2A continuous
  * Use a USB current meter (inline tester) to measure actual draw

* Would you like help picking a specific relay/MOSFET or designing a power switch that handles this safely?

**ChatGPT Question: "damage of arduino portable hard disk usb switch using relay"**

* If you’re asking about possible damage risks when controlling a portable hard disk’s USB power using an Arduino-controlled relay switch, here’s a detailed explanation:

* Scenario:
  * You use an Arduino and a relay to turn ON/OFF the 5V USB power line feeding a portable USB hard disk (HDD or SSD).

* Potential Damage Risks:

  * 1. Hard Drive Data Corruption or Damage
    * Cutting power abruptly with a relay while the drive is running can cause:
      * File system corruption (if the drive is writing/reading data).
      * Operating system freezes or errors.
      * Potential damage to the drive's electronics if power is unstable.
    * Unlike mechanical switches designed for safe eject or unmount, relay power switching is a hard power cut.

  * 2. Relay Switching Noise and Voltage Spikes
    * Mechanical relays can cause:
      * Voltage spikes or arcing when switching on/off.
      * These spikes can potentially harm sensitive electronics inside the hard drive or the USB controller.
    * Use of snubber circuits (diode, RC network) across relay contacts can help suppress spikes.

  * 3. Power Supply Inrush Current
    * When relay closes and powers the drive, inrush current can be high.
    * This can cause:
      * Voltage dips affecting Arduino or USB port.
      * Stress on power supply and relay contacts.

  * 4. USB Data Line Issues
    * Relay usually only switches the 5V power line.
    * The data lines remain connected.
    * Powering off the drive abruptly while data lines stay connected may confuse the host computer’s USB controller, causing device errors or requiring a replug.

* How to Mitigate Damage:
  * Tip => Explanation
  * Unmount/Eject drive properly first => Prevents data corruption before power cut
  * Add soft delay in Arduino code => Allow drive to spin down before cutting power
  * Use a relay designed for DC switching => Reduces arcing and contact wear
  * Consider a solid-state relay (SSR) => SSRs switch faster with less noise
  * Add RC snubber or diode across relay contacts => Suppresses voltage spikes
  * Cut both power and data lines (if possible) => Avoids USB confusion
  * Use powered USB hubs with software control => Better for safe on/off control than hard relay switching

* Summary:
  * Risk => How Serious => How to Avoid
  * Data corruption => High => Proper eject before power off
  * Voltage spikes damaging HDD => Medium (rare but possible) => Use snubber, SSR, and good relay
  * USB errors => Medium => Cut power and data or safe eject
  * Relay contact wear => Medium => Use relay rated for DC switching

* If you want, I can help design a safer circuit or suggest software-controlled USB hubs or USB power switches better suited for this task.

* In short:
  * Using a relay to switch the USB power of a portable HDD can damage data or hardware if not done carefully, especially if you cut power abruptly without safely unmounting the drive. Always eject the drive first, and consider protecting circuits for hardware longevity.

## Timely Provide Water In Garden <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGPT Question: "use arduino to timely provide water in garden"**

* You can absolutely use an Arduino to create a simple automatic garden watering system! It’s a classic and highly practical project.

* What You Can Build
  * An Arduino-based timed watering system that:
    * Turns on a water pump or valve at a set time
    * Waters the garden for a fixed duration
    * Repeats daily (or multiple times per day)
    * Optionally uses a soil moisture sensor or `RTC (real-time clock)` for smarter control

* Basic Components (Minimal Timed Version)
  * Component => Purpose
  * Arduino Uno/Nano => Controls the logic
  * Relay Module (or MOSFET) => Turns water pump/valve on/off
  * 5V/12V DC water pump or solenoid valve => Delivers water
  * Power supply (battery, adapter) => Powers pump and Arduino
  * Tubing + water container => Irrigation setup
  * (Optional) RTC module (DS3231) => Accurate timekeeping
  * (Optional) Soil moisture sensor => Water only when dry

* Sample Code: Simple Timed Watering (No RTC, Fixed Intervals)
  * This code will water for 10 seconds every hour (customizable):
```cpp
const int pumpPin = 8; // Connected to relay IN pin
unsigned long lastWatered = 0;
const unsigned long interval = 3600000UL; // 1 hour in milliseconds
const unsigned long wateringDuration = 10000UL; // 10 seconds

void setup() {
  pinMode(pumpPin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(pumpPin, LOW); // Relay OFF
}

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  if (currentMillis - lastWatered >= interval) {
    digitalWrite(pumpPin, HIGH); // Turn on pump
    delay(wateringDuration);     // Wait
    digitalWrite(pumpPin, LOW);  // Turn off pump

    lastWatered = currentMillis;
  }
}
```
  * This version runs from startup, but millis() resets on power loss, and there’s no real-time tracking.

* Improved Version: Add Real-Time Clock (RTC)
  * Add a DS3231 RTC module so Arduino knows the actual time of day (e.g. water at 6:00 AM daily).
  * Bonus:
    * RTC remembers time even after power loss
    * You can schedule based on actual hours
  * Would you like this version with RTC? I can give you full code with time-based scheduling.

* Optional: Add Soil Moisture Sensor
  * Water only if the soil is dry:
    * 1. Connect analog soil moisture sensor
    * 2. Read value (e.g., dry = >700)
    * 3. Water only if dry and time is right

* Safety and Practical Tips
  * Tip => Why
  * Use flyback diode on relay/pump => Protects Arduino from voltage spikes
  * Use external power for pump => Don't overload Arduino's 5V pin
  * Use waterproof enclosure => For outdoor setup
  * Use a 12V solenoid valve => If using tap water pressure

* Summary
  * Want this? => Use this:
  * Timed watering (simple) => Arduino + relay + delay logic
  * Precise daily watering => Add RTC (DS3231)
  * Smart watering => Add soil sensor
  * Remote control => Add ESP32/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth later

* Would you like a full wiring diagram, RTC-based version, or an ESP32 Wi-Fi controlled version? Just let me know!

## Make Water Level Indicator And Switch For Water Tank <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGPT Question: "control smart wifi plug using esp32"**

* Controlling a smart Wi-Fi plug using an ESP32 is possible, but the approach depends on the plug model and whether it allows local control (LAN access) or only through the cloud.

* Ways to Control a Smart Plug Using ESP32

  * 1. Use a Plug with Local API (Tuya, Tasmota, Shelly, etc.)
    * Heading: Plug Type => Control Method
    * Tasmota-flashed smart plug => Control via HTTP/MQTT
    * Tuya (local mode) => Use `Tuya-Convert`, or control via local API with `libretuya`
    * Shelly plug => HTTP REST or MQTT over local network
    * Best Option: Reflash with Tasmota or buy plugs that support local REST or MQTT control

  * 2. Control via HTTP (e.g., Tasmota or Shelly)
    * Assuming your smart plug has a local web API, your ESP32 can send HTTP requests over Wi-Fi.
    * ESP32 Arduino Example (Tasmota/Shelly):
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>

const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

const char* plug_ip = "192.168.1.50";  // IP of your smart plug

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }

  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");

  // Send command to turn plug ON
  HTTPClient http;
  String url = String("http://") + plug_ip + "/cm?cmnd=Power%20On";  // for Tasmota
  http.begin(url);
  int httpCode = http.GET();

  if (httpCode > 0) {
    Serial.printf("Plug Response: %s\n", http.getString().c_str());
  } else {
    Serial.println("Failed to send request");
  }

  http.end();
}

void loop() {
  // Nothing for now
}
```
    * Tasmota Commands:
      * Turn ON: `http://<plug_ip>/cm?cmnd=Power%20On`
      * Turn OFF: `http://<plug_ip>/cm?cmnd=Power%20Off`

  * 3. Control via MQTT
    * If your plug uses MQTT (e.g., Tasmota, Shelly in MQTT mode), you can use the `PubSubClient` library on the ESP32.
```cpp
client.publish("tasmota/plug/cmnd/Power", "ON");
```

  * 4. What if the Plug Only Works With an App (Cloud-only)?
    * Cloud-only plugs (e.g., most TP-Link, Meross, etc.) need workarounds:
      * Heading: Option => Description
      * Flash firmware => Use `Tuya-Convert` or open-source tools to reflash with Tasmota/ESPHome
      * Reverse engineer API => Some like TP-Link Kasa can be controlled via local API (search for libraries like `tplink-smarthome`)
      * Use Home Assistant as bridge => ESP32 → MQTT → Home Assistant → Smart Plug via its integration
    * Many new plugs block local access, making ESP32 control hard or impossible without reflashing or reverse engineering.

* Summary
  * Heading: Scenario => ESP32 Control Method
  * Tasmota / Shelly plug => HTTP or MQTT
  * Tuya (w/ local mode) => HTTP or `libretuya`
  * Cloud-only plug => Use Home Assistant or flash custom firmware
  * Building your own smart plug => Control relay directly via GPIO

* If you tell me the brand/model of your smart plug, I can give you exact instructions on how to control it using your ESP32.

## Arduino Based CCTV Camera <sup>ChatGPT</sup>

**ChatGPT Question: "cctv camera setup using arduino, camera module, android mobile and store to google drive"**

* Setting up a CCTV-like surveillance system using an Arduino, camera module, Android mobile, and Google Drive is a creative project—but it’s important to know the limitations and best practices for each component. Here's a step-by-step guide:

* Overview
  * You want to:
    * 1. Use a camera module with Arduino (e.g. OV7670 or ESP32-CAM),
    * 2. Capture images or video,
    * 3. Send the data to an Android mobile, and
    * 4. Automatically upload it to Google Drive for storage.

* Recommended Hardware Setup

  * Option 1: Use ESP32-CAM
    * Rather than a regular Arduino (like Uno), use ESP32-CAM:
      * It has Wi-Fi, microcontroller, and a camera built-in.
      * Much more capable for image/video transmission than Uno/Nano + OV7670.

  * Components Needed:
    * ESP32-CAM board with OV2640 camera
    * FTDI USB-to-Serial adapter (for programming ESP32-CAM)
    * MicroSD card (optional for local backup)
    * Android phone (with internet connection & automation app like Tasker or Termux)
    * Google account with Google Drive access

* Software & Communication Flow
  * 1. ESP32-CAM captures an image or video frame.
  * 2. Sends it over Wi-Fi to an Android device (e.g., via HTTP server or direct connection).
  * 3. Android app (like Tasker, Termux, or a custom app) receives the file.
  * 4. The Android device uploads it to Google Drive using Google Drive API or a sync folder.

* Step-by-Step Guide

  * 1. Set Up ESP32-CAM
    * Install Arduino IDE
    * Add ESP32 Board Manager (from Espressif)
    * Use example code: `CameraWebServer` (in Arduino IDE under File > Examples > ESP32)
    * Modify Wi-Fi credentials in code:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "your_wifi_ssid";
const char* password = "your_wifi_password";
```
    * Upload code using FTDI module (connect GPIO 0 to GND during upload).

  * 2. Capture & Send Image
    * Use ESP32-CAM to host a web server that:
    * Takes a photo when accessed (`/capture`)
    * Sends image as HTTP response
  * Example image capture URL:
```arduino
http://192.168.x.x/capture
```

  * 3. Connect Android & Automate
    * Option A: Use Tasker + AutoTools plugin
      * Periodically make HTTP request to ESP32-CAM `/capture`
      * Save image to Android storage
      * Use AutoTools or Tasker action to upload to Google Drive via sync folder (like using FolderSync or Google Drive app)
    * Option B: Use Termux (Advanced)
      * Install Termux and packages:
```bash
pkg install curl
pkg install termux-api
```
    * Script to:
      * Call ESP32-CAM `/capture` URL via `curl`
      * Save image to local storage
      * Upload to Google Drive using rclone or REST API (or sync via shared folder)

  * 4. Upload to Google Drive
    * Option A: Use Google Drive App + Sync Folder
      * Save captured images to a folder synced with Google Drive.
      * Google Drive app automatically uploads.
    * Option B: Use rclone (via Termux)
      * Set up `rclone` in Termux to link with Google Drive
```bash
rclone config
rclone copy image.jpg remote:ESP32_Cam
```

* Limitations to Consider
  * Limitation => Notes
  * Arduino Uno/Nano => Not fast or powerful enough for image processing
  * ESP32-CAM => No battery; needs 5V stable power supply
  * Android phone => Needs automation setup or custom app
  * Google Drive API => Has quotas & requires login/consent flow

* Best Setup (Recommended)
  * Heading: Component => Choice/Tool
  * Camera module => ESP32-CAM (OV2640)
  * Communication => Wi-Fi + HTTP GET
  * Android app => Tasker, Termux, or custom
  * Upload method => Google Drive App or rclone
  * Storage sync => Google Drive sync folder

* Want a Simpler Version?
  * Use an Android-only CCTV setup using the free app AlfredCamera or IP Webcam, and skip Arduino altogether.

* Would you like a complete Arduino sketch + Android script example for this setup?
