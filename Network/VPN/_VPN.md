## Notes

* VPN = Virtual Private Network

* Can not use multiple VPN/Mesh-VPN at the same time. Example: can not use Tailscale/Headscale (Mesh-VPN) and ProtonVPN (Traditional-VPN) at the same time.

* Use Mesh-VPN like Tailscale, Headscale, NetBird, Netmaker, ZeroTier to inter-connect remotely located devices and transfer/share data. Can not use two Mesh-VPN at the same time.
